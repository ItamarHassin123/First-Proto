this is the first final prototype fot the driver detection project. It includes manual testing and a ui.

How to use?
To use through the ui, run RunUi.bat and enter email when prompted in cmd. this will open up a browser using streamlit.
To test manually, run Cam-Custom/Transfer

Important things:
- the model wont work through your webcam unless you situate it in the correct positioning in the car (see test videos)
